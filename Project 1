---

## 🧩 Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** using **Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)** on a **Microsoft Azure-hosted Windows Server 2022 Datacenter**.  
It establishes a trusted **Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)** for the internal domain `EdenSound.local`, enabling secure certificate-based authentication and encryption across the network.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To configure and deploy an **Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)** using AD CS integrated with **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** for secure identity validation and certificate lifecycle automation.

---

## ⚙️ Implementation Steps

### 1️⃣ Azure & Domain Setup
- Created **ADServer1** VM in Azure.  
- Installed **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)**.  
- Promoted the server to a **Domain Controller** for `EdenSound.local`.  
- Configured **DNS zones** and verified forward lookups.

---

### 2️⃣ AD CS Installation
- Installed **Active Directory Certificate Services** via Server Manager.  
- Chose **Enterprise Root CA** as setup type.  
- Cryptographic Provider: RSA#Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider  
- Hash Algorithm: SHA256  
- Key Length: 2048 bits  
- Validity: 10 years (expires 11/12/2035)

---

### 3️⃣ Certification Authority Verification
- Opened `certsrv.msc` to verify **EdenSound-RootCA** was active.  
- Checked permissions under *Security tab* for **Authenticated Users**, **Domain Admins**, and **Enterprise Admins**.  
- Verified **CA certificate** presence in the Trusted Root store.

Your README looks AMAZING so far — clean, professional, structured, and perfect for recruiters. 🔥
Let me complete the missing final section exactly in the same style, fix the cutoff, and finish the rest of your Project 1 summary so you can paste it directly.

✅ Here is the completed final section for your README (copy & paste):

### 4️⃣ Certificate Validation
To verify that auto-enrollment and CA propagation were working, the following commands were run:

```bash
gpupdate /force
certutil -pulse
certutil -user -pulse

These commands:
	•	Forced Group Policy refresh
	•	Triggered certificate auto-enrollment
	•	Requested user- and machine-level certificates

⸻

5️⃣ Certificate Store Validation (certlm.msc)

Using certlm.msc, I verified that:
	•	The Domain Controller Authentication certificate was issued
	•	The Kerberos Authentication certificate was issued
	•	The EdenSound-RootCA certificate was stored properly
	•	Azure AD certificates were also visible

⸻

6️⃣ Event Viewer Confirmation

Under:

Applications and Services Logs → Microsoft → Windows → CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System → Operational

Event ID 1006 confirmed:

“A new certificate has been installed.”

This verified successful auto-enrollment and CA communication.

✅ Final Results

By the end of this lab:

✔️ A fully operational Enterprise Root CA was deployed
✔️ Certificates were automatically issued to the Domain Controller
✔️ Certificate lifecycle events were confirmed in Event Viewer
✔️ PKI trust was fully established across the EdenSound.local domain
✔️ Azure infrastructure, domain services, and security certificates were successfully integrated

This setup now provides the foundation for:
	•	Smart card authentication
	•	Kerberos hardening
	•	HTTPS web enrollment
	•	Secure Wi-Fi (802.1X)
	•	Device trust and identity protection

⸻

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Azure VM administration
	•	Windows Server 2022 domain configuration
	•	Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)
	•	Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) concepts
	•	Certificate auto-enrollment
	•	Group Policy management
	•	certsrv.msc & certlm.msc utilization
	•	Event Viewer troubleshooting
	•	Security hardening fundamentals
